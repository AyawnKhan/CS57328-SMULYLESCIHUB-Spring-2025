# 🚀 Team Collaboration Repository

Welcome to the central repository for all development teams. This repository is structured to support collaboration, transparency, and organized sprint submissions across all 8 teams.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each team has a dedicated directory:

Inside each directory, teams should organize their code by **sprints**.


## 🧭 Team Instructions

- ✅ **Use only your assigned folder.**
- ✅ Organize your submissions by sprint (`sprint1/`, `sprint2/`, etc.).
- ✅ Include a `README.md` in each sprint folder describing:
  - Sprint goal
  - Features implemented
  - Team members
  - How to run/test your code

## 🛑 Repository Rules

- ❌ Do not modify code or folders outside your assigned directory.
- ✅ Follow the naming conventions strictly (e.g., `sprint1`, `sprint2`, etc.)
- ✅ Use pull requests if you're working on a branch before merging to `main`.
